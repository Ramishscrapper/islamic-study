              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
              himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on
              his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
              see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
              stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed
              ready to slide off any moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest
              of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to
              me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
              although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
              familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on
              the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there
              hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
              magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady
              fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a
              heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the
              viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull
              weather.
